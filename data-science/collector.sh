    # 'jq' command explanation:
    # -r: output raw strings, not JSON-escaped strings.
    # .records[]: iterate over each element in the "records" array.
    # |: pipe the output of the previous filter to the next one.
    # [.id, .created_at, .color, .roll, .server_seed]: create an array of these specific values for each record.
    # | @csv: format the array as a CSV row.
